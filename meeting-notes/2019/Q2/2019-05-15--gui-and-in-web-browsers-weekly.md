## ðŸ“¦ npm-on-ipfs - where we're at & what's next.
> [name=achingbrain]

* achingbrain
   - npm-on-ipfs is a mirror of the public registry that adds CIDs to the "packuments"
   - client side component runs a local web server
   - describes how it works
 * olizilla
   - we are running a centralized service for the registry service
   - to achingbrain, "where's your head at?"
 * achingbrain
   - bug in unixfs exporter in js-ipfs - got fixed, async/await refactoring
   - next week:
     - new packages announced on pubsub, but no signatures, could be poisoned
     - npm client will validate tarballs
     - worst case, fallbacks to public registry
   - we are only mirroring a centralized service
   - protocol handler? ipfs://... or ipns://...
   - publish own packuments on IPNS
   - idea: search engine for packages published via IPNS or github
   - problem: IPNS is slow ... quick in future?
 * victorb
   - multiformat for packages in different registries?
   - openregistry
     - part of a bigger effort to create open infrastructure
       - "open services"
       - funded by community
     - openregistry vs. npm-on-ipfs
       - not developed by private company
       - expenses/income public, everything public
       - lazy registry
       - bolivar, written in go, is the client
  * olizilla
    - overlap between projects
    - feedback helps to direct performance improvements in IPFS
  * victorb
    - bolivar is faster than downloading from npm
  * olizilla
    - ipfs-on-npm in ipfs-desktop being released in a little while
    - didn't realize how similar openregistry was with npm-on-ipfs
  * victorb
    - openregistry is intended to be a universal registry
  * olizilla
    - ability to co-host things that i depend on
    - how to represent to the users what they are doing?
  * achingbrain
    - offline, no left-pad
    - github has automated blocking on vulnerabilites
  * jimpick
    - people may want to mirror to provide sustainability
  * jessica
    - showing chatty output on terminal is good if performance is bad
    - interesting to see if change npm default ... will people notice?
  * olizilla
    - ok if there's a big opt-in switch in the UI?
  * chriswaring
    - what about switching node versions?
  * olizilla
    - vote on overriding npm? 50/50 result
    - feature in UI for opting in to experiments
    - Q: Does desktop have a CLI? A: next version will introduce ipfs cli
    - Q: Does it work with yarn? A: yes, you get ipfs-npm and ipfs-yarn
    - Q: Does integration install ipfs-npm via npm? A: That was the plan.
    - Bootstrapping issue
  * chriswaring
    - Might not be able to answer "why?" on first attempt
  * achingbrain
    - Distributed identity coming to help solve

## ðŸš€ What needs to be done to release ipfs-npm with ipfs-desktop
> [name=olizilla]

### Focus

- is this an experiment to stress test ipfs or a service we intend to support?

### Speed

- Clean install of `iim` takes ~10s via `npm` & ~40s via `ipfs-npm`
  - https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/npm-on-ipfs/pull/103
- Subsequent install should be faster?
- Can the LAN install be as fast as an optimised http install?
- Perf issue: https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/npm-on-ipfs/issues/65

### Infra

- registry stability https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/npm-on-ipfs/issues/90
- blocked on infra team time

### Useful co-hosting

- How do we indicate that you are sharing things you download back to the network
- No bandwidth stats per CID, can we workaround that?
- Under what secanrios does it work?
  - have we tested LAN only installs?

### UX CLI

- Quiter installs AKA: what should the CLI say
- Don't invoke IPFS for local commands like `npm ls`
  - https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/npm-on-ipfs/issues/95
- Do invoke IPFS for `npx` 
  - https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/npm-on-ipfs/issues/96

### Integration with Desktop UI

- Should it alias `npm` to `ipfs-npm` when enabled?
- fsdiogo
  - add a tab where the user can view installed packages
  - be able to browse, install and remove packages
  - may be a bit of a stretch, but have a visualization with the history of the installed/removed packages
